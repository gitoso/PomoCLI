# PomoCLI

Yeah, it seems that software is becoming more and more a commodity with the advances in AI. I was studying and wanted a simple Pomodoro timer app. I did what I usually do, opened the browser and started searching for a good app. But I just wanted something really simple, a simple CLI app would suffice, so I ended up opening Claude Code and one-shotting this simple app that does exactly  what I wanted.
